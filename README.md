# Pokemon Image Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classify Pokemons  based on their type using dataset images. The goal of this project is to enhance the dataset by applying various data augmentation techniques, which can improve the performance of machine learning models.

## Features
- **Data Augmentation:** Techniques such as rotation, flipping, scaling, and more are applied to generate new training data from existing images.
- **Image Processing:** Preprocessing steps to ensure consistency in image size, format, and resolution.
- **Improved Model Training:** Augmented data helps build more robust and generalized machine learning models.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook pokedex_after_data_augmentation.ipynb
```
3. Run the notebook cell by cell to augment the dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on your setup)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
